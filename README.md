1 - Open the project in Xcode.

2 - Hit "run" to deploy to simulator or connected device.

This project was completed in approximately 3 hours.

Although this project does not complete all requirments it is a fair reflection of my skills and abilities at the moment.

Unfortunately, I did not have an iPhone and was unable to test on a physical device.

An iPhone is required for this assignment as it uses sensors that are not present on the similator.
